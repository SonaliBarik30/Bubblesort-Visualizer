# Bubble Sort Visualizer

A dynamic and interactive Bubble Sort Visualizer built using **Java**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. This project visually demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm in action, making it easier to understand how the sorting process works.

## 🚀 Features

- Visual representation of Bubble Sort using color-coded bars  
- Real-time sorting visualization  
- Customizable array sizes for different sorting scenarios  
- Responsive user interface with HTML and CSS  

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **User Interface:** The HTML/CSS front-end displays an interactive visualization grid.  
2. **Algorithm Integration:** Java handles the Bubble Sort logic and communicates with the UI for updates.  
3. **Visualization:** Bars are dynamically updated to represent the current state of sorting, including swaps and comparisons.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend Logic:** Java  
- **Communication:** Embedded server or web framework (if applicable)  

## 📚 Algorithm: Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed.

### Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n)  
- Average Case: O(n²)  
- Worst Case: O(n²)  

### Space Complexity:
- O(1)
